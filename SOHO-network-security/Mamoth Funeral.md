Small Office Network Security Hardening

Overview
This project involved a rapid response to a Wi-Fi password breach at Mamoth Funeral Service.  
The objective was to restore secure network access, implement a robust security posture, and document the process for future reference.  

This project demonstrates practical skills in:
- Network administration  
- Security incident response  
- Client communication

Key Responsibilities & Actions Taken

1. Security Incident Response
- Performed an immediate factory reset of the Huawei router to clear all compromised configurations.  
- Eliminated the breached Wi-Fi password and any altered admin credentials.  

2. Router Configuration & Administration
- Accessed the router web interface with default admin credentials.  
- Set a new, strong administrative password to protect settings.  
- Configured WLAN settings:  
  - Created a new, unique SSID  
  - Set WPA2-PSK (AES) for encryption  
  - Generated a complex Wi-Fi password  

3. Network Security Enhancement
- Disabled WPS to remove a known security vulnerability.  
- Created a separate guest network to isolate visitor traffic.  
- Performed a firmware update to patch vulnerabilities.  
- Audited connected devices to verify only authorized office equipment.  

4. Documentation & Training
- Provided the client with a step-by-step connection guide.  
- Educated on the importance of strong, unique passwords.  
- Advised on regular password changes and best practices.
